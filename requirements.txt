The file 'requirements.txt' is used to list the dependencies required by a Python project. Based on the provided blueprint, I will create a 'requirements.txt' file that includes the necessary dependencies for the SafeDrive project. 

Here is the complete, functional source code for the 'requirements.txt' file:

numpy==1.23.4
pandas==1.5.2
scikit-learn==1.2.0
matplotlib==3.6.2
seaborn==0.12.1
scipy==1.10.0
autograd==1.3
tensorflow==2.11.0
keras==2.11.0
pytorch==2.0.1
torchvision==0.15.1
pyautogui==0.9.50
python-iso26262==0.1.0  # For ISO 26262 compliance
autosar==0.1.0  # For AUTOSAR compliance
requests==2.28.2
flask==2.2.3
sqlalchemy==1.4.44
psycopg2==2.9.5
python-dotenv==0.21.0

Note: The versions of the dependencies may vary based on the specific requirements of the project. The above list includes some of the most commonly used dependencies in a machine learning and autonomous driving project.

Also, please note that the 'python-iso26262' and 'autosar' libraries are not real libraries and are used here for demonstration purposes only. In a real-world project, you would need to use actual libraries that provide the necessary functionality for ISO 26262 and AUTOSAR compliance. 

As of 2025-12-06, the ISO 26262 standard is widely adopted in the automotive industry for ensuring functional safety in automotive systems. The SafeDrive project will adhere to this standard to provide a reliable and secure solution for automotive manufacturers and suppliers.
